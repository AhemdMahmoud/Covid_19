# Covid_19
## Project Description
#### The data used in this project will help `to identify whether a person is going to recover from  coronavirus symptoms or not based on some pre-defined standard symptoms`. These symptoms are  based on `guidelines given by the World Health Organization (WHO)`.
#### This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from  2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.
#### The data is available from 22 Jan, 2020. Data is in “data.csv”.
#### The dataset contains 14 major variables that will be having an impact on whether someone has recovered or not, the description of each variable are as follows,
### * 1. `Country`: where the person resides
### * 2.` Location`: which part in the Country
### * 3. `Age`: Classification of the age group for each person, based on WHO Age Group Standard
### * 4.` Gender`: Male or Female 
### * 5.` Visited_Wuhan`: whether the person has visited Wuhan, China or not
### * 6. `From_Wuhan`: whether the person is from Wuhan, China or not
### * 7.` Symptoms`: there are six families of symptoms that are coded in six fields.
### * 13. `Time_before_symptoms_appea`r: 
### * 14.` Result`: death (1) or recovered (0) It is required to design different classifiers to the predict the outcome (death/recovered) when a new person is admitted to the hospital. The data is already cleaned and preprocessed.
##  will have to divide the data into three partitions: training, validation, and testing. You need to 
design the following classifiers:
### * 1. `K-Nearest Neighbors`
### * 2.` Logistic Regression`
### * 3.` Naïve Bayes `
### * 4. `Decision Trees`
### * 5. `Support Vector Machines` 
## For each classifier, try to find the `optimal hyperparameters`.
# You also need to compare `the performance of all classifiers` using different metrics such as the 
`precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/AUC curves`
